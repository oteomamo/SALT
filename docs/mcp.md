# 🔌 MCP server

`salt-mcp` puts SALT behind the Model Context Protocol, so an editor or
an agent runtime can compress text through the same engine `salt` and
`saltChat` use. It speaks JSON-RPC over stdio and is started by the
client, not by you.

## Install

The server ships with the optional extra:

```bash
pip install "salt[mcp]"
```

Check it:

```bash
salt-mcp --version
```

## Point a client at it

Most clients read a JSON file naming the servers they may start. The
entry for SALT is the command and its flags:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "salt": {
      "command": "salt-mcp",
      "args": ["--gpu", "0"]
    }
  }
}
```

The server loads the encoder on the first call that needs it, so a
client that connects and asks for nothing pays nothing.

## Server flags

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--version` | print the SALT version this server carries and exit |
| `--device` | device for the encoder (default: `cuda` when there is one, else `cpu`) |
| `--gpu` | CUDA index or comma list, with the encoder on the last card |
| `--bge-device` | device for the encoder, winning over `--device` |

There is no GPU requirement. On a machine without one the encoder runs
on the CPU, which is slower per call but needs nothing installed beyond
the package.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `salt_compress` | compress one text to a fraction of its words |

### salt_compress

| Argument | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `text` | the text to compress (required) |
| `budget_pct` | the share of the original words to keep, `0.2` by default |
| `query` | what the compression should favor, optional |

It returns the compressed text and the numbers behind it: how many
words went in and came back, how many sentences were found and kept,
the word budget, the token count of the result, and the share of the
text's themes the result still covers.

Without a query the result keeps what covers the text as a whole. With
one, the selection is biased toward the sentences that answer it, which
is the same thing a saltChat turn does with its memory.

Compression is prose-shaped here: sentences are cleaned, split and
filtered, then selected under the budget. That is the same path the
`salt` command runs, with the same defaults, so a tool call and a
command line give the same answer for the same text.
